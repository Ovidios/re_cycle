## About
![gif showing the game](github_resources/sc1.gif)

reðŸŸ¡cycle is a fast-paced word-puzzle-ish game where you try to achieve a high score by typing leters, forming (only!) words, fulfilling quests, leveling up and strategically using a limited number of spaces.

This game was built for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) 54 compo in less than 48h. Rate it [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/recycle)! (Or just run it using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), or download the Windows/Mac binaries on [itch.io](https://ovidios.itch.io/re-cycle))
